# Distracted_driver_detection

##Problem Statement-

Given the dataset consisting of driver images in car and corresponding labels for 10 nos. categories (e.g. safe driving, texting, talking etc.), your task is to build a classification model to predict the category for that image.

##Implementation-
In this project, I have created and refined machine learning models to detect what the driver is doing in a car given driver images. This is done by predicting the likelihood of what the driver is doing in each picture.
